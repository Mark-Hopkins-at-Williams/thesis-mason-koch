	Immediate future
Mess around with full_health variable.

	Move to 3v3 and so on and so forth, then do:
Patch preprocess_observation_smogon.
Finalise how many status conditions you are going to have and update game_model accordingly. For instance, confusion is not mutually exclusive with the other status conditions. And you might want to know how many turns the Pokemon has been asleep.
Learn more about the Pokemon game mechanics (e.g. volatiles) and add those to the state.
Fix abominable performance.
Could sub out some modules with prebuilt ones from pytorch or tensorflow.
Remember previous games? Just the x values, the chosen action, and the rewards. And then backprop on a larger sample set.
Change learning rate?
Why did multinet_lenenv_nomean_normalisation_aggronC look like a boomerang?
Make experiment graphs prettier.
Delete the division by the standard deviation? It's not really applicable to what we are doing. If we do this we might have to increase the learning rate.
